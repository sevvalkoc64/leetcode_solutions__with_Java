# leetcode_solutions_with_Java
I'm trying to solve leetcode problems with java and uploaded the problems I solved here.
I am trying to use classes methods and get the given numbers from the user. Because of this, solutions may not compile correctly in leetcode. But the solution logic is the same

## 1- problem_01: TWO SUM

### Description:

We need to print the indexed elements that give the target total value from the array elements.
I got these values from user. I wrote the process in "twosum" class step by step methods and I completed the problem by calling
these methods in the main class.
